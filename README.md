# Sample app for NLJUG Java Magazine september 2022

This is a sample app used in my article in the Dutch Java magazine issued September 2022.

It is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) based project, so you can open this project with any Maven compatible Java IDE to build and run tests.

## Useful commands

 * `mvn package`     compile and run tests
 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
